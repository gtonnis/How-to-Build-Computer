          <p>What are you going to use your Computer for?</p>
          <li>Office PC: Running applications like Word and maybe some web browsing.</li>
          <li>Media PC: 4k video or audio editing?</li>
          <li>Gaming PC: Streaming online content, playing games, and anything else you can think of.
          <p>Office PC: is the simplist, and costs the least. Media PC: needs mid to high end parts depending on if your viewing or editing 4k Video. Gaming PC: needs high performance parts to get the best experience, and tends to cost the most.</p>

           <p><b>1)</b> Take the CPU out of the box, don't touch the pins! Line it up, and drop it into place. <b>2)</b> Your CPU cooler might already have thermal paste on it. If it doesn't put a small pea sized amount on the top of the CPU. Screw the Cooler down alternating corners until it is secure. Then plug the Cooler into the motherboard. <b>3)</b> You'll probably need to install more stand off's before you install the mother board. Line up the I/O shield, drop it into place, and screw it down. <b>4)</b> The DDR4 Ram only goes in one way. Refer to the motherboards manuel. Depending on how many sticks of ram you have, it will vary exactly where you place them. <b>5)</b> If you bought a Hard Drive you will need to use a sata cable to attach it to the motherboard. You'll use screws to attach it to a sliding tray.  If you have an SSD review motherboard manuel to locate M.2 slots for your ssd. It should slide into place and screw the heat shield back down. <b>6)</b> Lay your Graphics card ontop of the PCIe slot on the motherboard. You will probably have to break out some of the case so it fits. Once you have the tabs off. Slide it into place and screw it down. <b>7)</b> Slide your power supply into place attach the 2 cables to the motherboard, and Sata power to Hard Drive if you have. <b>8)</b>Run your cables though your case to make them look nice. Once your happy with cable management. Screw the power supply into place. <b>9)</b> Finish pluging in the case switches, fans, or any RGB lights. Check everything is connected BEFORE closing up the case.</p>
